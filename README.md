# Airplane-Seating

The problem statement is to allocate each passenger to a seat which is given as the input to the program based on the following constraints.
  - Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back, starting from the left to the right
  - Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center seats (any order in center seats)
  
This is written using python3. To run the program run ```python seating.py``` in the command prompt. This will return the desired output in the terminal.
